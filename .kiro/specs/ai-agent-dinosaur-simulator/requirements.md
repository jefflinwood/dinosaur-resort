# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Agent Dinosaur Simulator is a SimCity-style simulation game featuring a dinosaur resort similar to Jurassic Park. The game orchestrates multiple AI agents representing different personalities (staff and visitors) using the ag2 framework in Python. Players can trigger events that cause agents to react dynamically until situations are resolved. The system tracks underlying metrics like visitor satisfaction and dinosaur happiness, all presented through a Streamlit dashboard interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to trigger events in the dinosaur resort, so that I can observe how AI agents react and resolve situations dynamically. I have a list of built-in events, but I can also type in an event, if I want to be creative.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player selects an event from the available options THEN the system SHALL trigger the event in the simulation
2. WHEN an event is triggered THEN all relevant AI agents SHALL receive notification of the event
3. WHEN agents receive an event notification THEN each agent SHALL react according to their personality and role
4. WHEN agents are reacting to an event THEN the system SHALL continue the simulation until the situation is resolved
5. WHEN the situation is resolved THEN the system SHALL update the game state and display the outcome

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see different AI agent personalities (staff and visitors) in the resort, so that the simulation feels realistic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize multiple AI agents with distinct personalities
2. WHEN displaying agents THEN the system SHALL show different agent types including staff members and visitors
3. WHEN an agent acts THEN their behavior SHALL be consistent with their assigned personality and role
4. WHEN agents interact THEN the system SHALL use the ag2 framework to orchestrate their communications
5. IF an agent is a staff member THEN they SHALL have resort management responsibilities
6. IF an agent is a visitor THEN they SHALL have tourist behaviors and expectations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to monitor resort metrics like visitor satisfaction and dinosaur happiness, so that I can understand the impact of events and agent actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL continuously track visitor satisfaction metrics
2. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL continuously track dinosaur happiness metrics
3. WHEN an event occurs THEN the system SHALL update relevant metrics based on the event impact
4. WHEN agents take actions THEN the system SHALL adjust metrics based on action effectiveness
5. WHEN metrics change THEN the system SHALL persist the updated values
6. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL show current values and historical trends

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with the simulation through a Streamlit dashboard, so that I have an intuitive interface to control and monitor the resort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a Streamlit dashboard interface
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the player SHALL see current resort status and metrics
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the player SHALL see all active AI agents and their current states
4. WHEN using the dashboard THEN the player SHALL be able to trigger available events through UI controls
5. WHEN events are triggered THEN the dashboard SHALL display real-time updates of agent reactions
6. WHEN metrics change THEN the dashboard SHALL update the displayed values in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to handle various types of resort events, so that the simulation offers diverse and interesting scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support dinosaur escape events
2. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support visitor emergency events
3. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support facility malfunction events
4. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support weather-related events
5. WHEN an event type is selected THEN the system SHALL provide specific event variations within that category
6. WHEN any event occurs THEN the system SHALL determine which agents are affected based on event type and location

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use the ag2 framework for agent orchestration, so that agent interactions are properly managed and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing agents THEN the system SHALL use ag2 framework components
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL route messages through ag2's orchestration layer
3. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL leverage ag2's conversation and reasoning capabilities
4. WHEN scaling the number of agents THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through ag2's management features
5. WHEN debugging agent behavior THEN the system SHALL provide ag2's built-in logging and monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the resolution of triggered events, so that I understand how the AI agents successfully handled the situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is in progress THEN the system SHALL display the current status and active agent responses
2. WHEN agents are working on resolution THEN the system SHALL show their collaborative efforts and communications
3. WHEN a resolution is achieved THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the event is resolved
4. WHEN an event is resolved THEN the system SHALL display a summary of actions taken and outcomes
5. WHEN multiple events occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle each event resolution independently
6. IF an event cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL escalate or provide alternative resolution paths

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want to take on the role of one of the agent categories and participate directly in the simulation through chat, so that I can influence events and interact with other AI agents as a human participant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a simulation THEN the player SHALL be able to select an agent category to role-play (staff member, visitor, or dinosaur handler)
2. WHEN the player selects a role THEN the system SHALL create a human-controlled agent with the appropriate role characteristics
3. WHEN events occur THEN the human player SHALL receive notifications and be able to respond through a chat interface
4. WHEN the player sends chat messages THEN the system SHALL integrate their responses into the ag2 agent conversation flow
5. WHEN other AI agents communicate THEN the human player SHALL see relevant messages directed to their role
6. WHEN the player participates in conversations THEN their input SHALL influence event resolution and agent decision-making
7. WHEN the player is inactive during an event THEN the system SHALL continue the simulation without blocking on human input
8. WHEN displaying the chat interface THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between AI agent messages and human player messages
9. WHEN the player changes roles THEN the system SHALL update their permissions and conversation access accordingly
